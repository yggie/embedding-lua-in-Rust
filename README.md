# embedding-lua-in-Rust
A simple proof of concept for embedding a Lua interpreter in Rust

## Additional Dependencies

The Lua C library must be available during compilation. You can get the latest
version of Lua from [lua.org](http://www.lua.org/). Alternatively, if you are
lazy (like me) and have Homebrew, you can get it with:

```
brew install lua
```
